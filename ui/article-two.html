			The first thing I learned was to look wide
			at the darkness

			and not want anything. He’d say, Just look 
			at the darkness

			and tell me what you see. I’d say, I see stars or
			Just the stars, Dad.

			And he’d say, Don’t call them that yet. What do you see?
			Just the stars, Dad.

			But then I’d be quiet and let my eyes go and look wide
			at the darkness.

			It was like a dome. I think it frightened me to stare
			at the darkness.

			I see light. I see a million little lights. And he’d say
			They aren’t all stars.

			Some were planets and some were planes and I’d say, Yeah,
			they aren’t all stars.

			But not really believe it. But say it so not to feel stupid out there
			in the darkness.
