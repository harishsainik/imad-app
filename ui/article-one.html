		<p>
			I want to be disability for you.
			Make new signs for you.
			They are saying things about us

			online in their underwear.
			The listserv is blowing up.
			Ableist verse, ableist verse

			and I’m talking to you.
			I’m a green circle for you
			and there you go again

			into my cover letters.
			Pinned your last dispatch
			to my Outlook so every day

			starts with you. Got your text.
			Got your chat. Got your tweet.
			Got you all over me.

			I want to be disability for you
			and capital crawl for you
			and accommodate you.
