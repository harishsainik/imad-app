			“Save your hands,” my mother says,
			seeing me untwist a jar’s tight cap—

			just the way she used to tell me
			not to let boys fool around, or feel

			my breasts: “keep them fresh
			for marriage,” as if they were a pair

			of actual fruit. I scoffed
			to think they could bruise, scuff,

			soften, rot, wither. I look down now
			at my knuckly thumbs, my index finger

			permanently askew in the same classic
			crook as hers, called a swan’s neck,

			as if snapped, it’s that pronounced.
			Even as I type, wondering how long

			I’ll be able to—each joint in my left hand
			needing to be hoisted, prodded, into place,

			one knuckle like a clock’s dial clicking
			as it’s turned to open, bend or unbend.

			I balk at the idea that we can overuse
			ourselves, must parcel out and pace

			our energies so as not to run out of any
			necessary component while still alive—

			the definition of “necessary” necessarily
			suffering change over time. 

			The only certainty is uncertainty, I thought
			I knew, so ignored whatever she said

			about boys and sex: her version of
			a story never mine. It made me laugh,

			the way she made up traditions, that we
			didn’t kiss boys until a certain age, we

			didn’t fool around. What we? What part of me
			was she? No part I could put my finger on.

			How odd, then, one day, to find her
			half-napping in her room, talking first

			to herself and then to me, about a boy
			she used to know, her friend’s brother,

			who she kissed, she said, just because 
			he wanted her to. “Now why would I do that,”

			she mused, distraught anew and freshly
			stung by the self-betrayal. So much 

			I still want to do with my hands—
			type, play, cook, caress, swipe, re-trace.
